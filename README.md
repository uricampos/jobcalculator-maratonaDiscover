# jobcalculator-maratonaDiscover

I made this project using the videos from https://maratonadiscover.rocketseat.com.br/maratona.

All this files were made by seing the insctructors Mayk and Jakeliny and trying to do it with them.

I could learn how to use nodeJS and EJS with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I learned how to refatorate my project making it more clear. At the end, I was able to understand how data bank works and use it with SQLite.

I appreciate all the Rocketseat team by doing this kind of projects and making possible that I, and all other students, could acquire knowledge.
